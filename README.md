#Welcome to my project
What does .gitignore do?
Its how git know which files it's supposed to ignore when making a repo and adding your project,
you'll find it n the root directory of a repo.
And Gemfile?
It's a file that people create to describe the gem dependencies to create a program in ruby.
And we should always place it at the root of the directory.
